# Quiz-app-back
Quiz app backend

This is a finall project for MegaK V3

This is my first independent project like that, I have never before used nest js.

This backend is working on quiz.radek.smallhost.pl

The purpose is to provide database for quiz app. It is very simple, it contains:
- listing questions;
- adding questions;
- edit and delete question;
- learning questions (random pickup of the question and check if it was correct answer).

  A lot has not been done:
  - errors handling - not completed;
  - there is no user option, no registration is required;
  - rate limiter;
  - ts types are not correct, I used a lot of any just to save time, I know it is wrong;
  - I plan to improve it in future with register/login and add collection to group questions.
